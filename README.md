This is the documents repo for fast partition experiment. If you do not know what that is you will not understand what is going on here at all, so I'd recommend you follow [this link](https://github.com/bananathrowingmachine/FastPartitionExperiment) and take a look to get the context.

Sections:

This repository is divided into 2 main sections, those being the example data and the worst case stress tests. 

The example data is here since my main program will delete any old data and replace it with a new set each time it is run, but it takes ages to run so this is data for quick viewing if you don't want to run the experiment again yourself. 
Each dated folder will have an .md file in it that links to the exact version of NewMemoizedCrazy.py that was used when the files were run. Due note that the first 2 runs of the full results occured before I created the split between NewMemoizedCrazy.py and OldMemoizedCrazy.py, where instead OldMemoizedCrazy.py was just known as MemoizedCrazy.py back then.

Finally, the stress tests will download the most recent version of NewMemoizedCrazy.py that's available on the git repo and then run the worst case scenarios on it.
