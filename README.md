Documents Repo:

This is the documents repo for fast partition experiment. If you do not know what that is you will not understand what is going on here at all, so I'd recommend you follow [this link](https://github.com/bananathrowingmachine/FastPartitionExperiment) and take a look to get the context.

Sections:

This repository is divided into 3 main sections, those being the example data, the typeset math documents, and the worst case stress tests. 

The example data is here since my main program will delete any old data and replace it with a new set each time it is run, but it takes ages to run so this is data for quick viewing if you don't want to run the experiment again yourself. 

The typeset math documents will be for any mathematical proofs that are created for this project, however do note that any proof documents will only be made in relation to either the "Memoized Crazy" variation as a whole or one of it's 2 main parts (the top down memoization or the absolute value trick). 

Finally, the stress tests will be a copy of the code I use to test how the "Memoized Crazy" variation of the algorithm preforms against specifically crafted worst case scenarios, all in one python file.
